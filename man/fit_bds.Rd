\arguments{
\item{phy}{an object of type phylo}

\item{sampling_fraction}{the probability that each species was sampled in the tree}

\item{lambda_hat}{the overall scale of the log-normal base distribution for the speciation rates. If not specified, the function will estimate it using ML}

\item{mu_hat}{the overall scale of the log-normal base distribution for the extinction rates. If not specified, the function will estimate it using ML}

\item{eta}{the shift rate parameter. If not specified, the function will estimate it using ML}

\item{num_speciation_classes}{the number of speciation rate class discretizations, such that rate categories is k = n_sp * n_mu}

\item{num_extinction_classes}{the number of extinction rate class discretizations, such that rate categories is k = n_sp * n_mu}

\item{sd}{the spread parameter for the log-normal base distribution}

\item{tol}{the local error threshold in the numerical ODE solver (per delta_t time step)}

\item{condition_survival}{whether or not to condition on the survival of the left and right lineages descending from the root (default TRUE)}

\item{condition_root_speciation}{whether or not to condition on that there was a speciation event at the root node (default TRUE)}

\item{condition_marginal}{whether or condition using the marginal or per-category approach (default FALSE, i.e., to condition per rate category)}

\item{extinction_approximation}{whether or not to approximate the extinction probability calculations, by assuming that rate shift events are not allowed on extinct lineages (default FALSE)}
